This code is in development. I basically have no idea if it's working or not, because I'm waiting for new chips to try on. Also, I'm waiting to get access to a Windows box again to be able to extract the source code of the Windows app, which has been put in a .exe for some reason. Anyway, if I have that source code I can compare the two.
